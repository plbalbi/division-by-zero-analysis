### Sensibility and Leaks analysis
Phase name: **jtp.SensibleData**

Evaluates whether a sensible value, marked the by the following method call:
```java
Object newSensibleObject;
analysis.SensibilityMarker.markAsSensible(newSensibleObject);
```
is leaked by some offending method. There's also a way of cleaning the sensitiveness of an object, by calling it upon
 this method:
```java
Object newSensibleObject;
analysis.SensibilityMarker.sanitize(newSensibleObject);
```
Both method are detected just by being declared as this [example](src/main/java/analysis/example/SensibilityMarker.java),
as long as they respect the package, method and class names.

The sensibility values belong to the lattice described below:
```
BOTTOM -> NOT_SENSIBLE ---> MAYBE_SENSIBLE (TOP)
       \                /
        `-> HIGH ------Â´
```

This is implemented in the class [SensibilityLattice](src/main/java/analysis/abstraction/SensibilityLattice.java
). The main operation is the `supremeBetween` operation which is the equivalent to the mathematical lattice operator.

When a local variable marked with a sensibility level `HIGH` reaches an offending method (currently just checking for
 `java.io.PrintStream#println`, but easily extensible), the analysis marks that statement as a leak-producer.

Summarizing, the analysis has the following features:

- **Inter-procedural**: See [this section](#inter-procedural-implementation-details) for more details.
- Handles just local assignment operations (does not support fields or array references).
- **Handles polymorphic calls**: See [this section](#Inter-procedural-implementation-details) for more details.

### Inter-procedural implementation details
#### Overview
The inter-procedural implementation of this analysis is both naive and technical is some characteristics. First, here
 are a few features implemented when handling method invocations:
- When the called method is defined in the same package being analyzed (in the user-code per-se, and not a third
 party library or a JVM-lib), the method called is fully analyzed running this same analysis in the invoked method
. This is done passing a context, which contains the sensibility level of the called method's arguments.
- Recursion not explicitly handled. A method that modifies the value every time, called recursively might make this
 analysis produce an `StackOverflowException` due to a number of nested calls analysis.
- Polymorphic calls handled.
- Non-user methods (those described in the first point) are handled with a [simplified invocation model](#simplification-model)

#### Simplification model
When a non-user method is called, one of two things can be done:
- Treat them as method calls, which implies analyzing the called method (which belongs to third-party libraries, JVM
 libraries of native code). This might be like a good idea, but there are some caveats:
  - The call-chains could be really long. For example calling the good-old `System.out.prinln` leads to a long chain
   of `PrintStream` indirections which use low-level JVM features.
  - Because the called method might use those low-level JVM features (`goto` statements for example, or some bit-based
  operator), their handlers have to be implemented in the analysis. This makes the model more and more complex as new
   methods need to be handled.
- Simplify invocation to non-user methods (in which for examples, we can have control of the language features used
), by a naive model which captures the effect those calls might have in the analysis we are performing.

While developing this analysis, I tried to implement the first one (without context sensitivity), but quickly run
into problems like `StackOverflowError` due to long chained-calls, or some other feature of the language not being
handled correctly or omitted by my analysis (array references for example). 

This led to choosing the latter option, and simplifying the invocation semantics for non-user methods. These can be
described with the following rules:
- If one of the arguments is labeled as sensible, and the method returns a non-void type, the returned value is
 sensible. This captures the usual calls to methods like `StringBuilder#append`.
- If the invocation is an instance invocation, and the receiver of the method call is a sensible value, the returned
 value is sensible. This captures calls like `someSensibleString.concat`.
 
Also, non-user called methods are that are not considered offending methods are assumed not never produce a leak as
side effect. This is a very naive approach, but since offending methods are checked way before this simplified method
is reached, this *can be assumed*.

This rules are implemented [here](https://github.com/thepalbi/soot-dataflow-analysis/blob/9a43888469f712b79a99987e8c2c1238b94c44d2/sensible-data-leak-detector/src/main/java/analysis/InvocationVisitor.java#L94).

#### Polymorphic calls handling
When an invoked method corresponds to an interface method, some extra information is needed to decide which
implementations is being called. Without additional settings, Soot is not able to provide the necessary to handle
this situations. To cope with this, before running the analysis, a points-to analysis is made to have information of
which Object might pointed from each local variable in the analyzed program. The points-to analysis a non-context-sensitive
Souffle based implementation. For details, check [this repo](https://github.com/thepalbi/souffle-points-to-analysis).

There might be some cases when the base object of the invocation points to several object (due to the lack of context
sensitivity of the analysis, for example). In those cases, every called is analyzed in a similar way, and the
results are merged making this decision in a MAY-fashion. This might generate false-positive, but helps in keeping
the overall analysis sound.

This is implemented in [here](https://github.com/thepalbi/soot-dataflow-analysis/blob/9a43888469f712b79a99987e8c2c1238b94c44d2/sensible-data-leak-detector/src/main/java/analysis/InvocationVisitor.java#L32.)

### Future work
All over the analysis code there are TODO's statements suggesting future improvements for this analysis. Overall
, they can be summarized with the following:
- Add more language features support (field-sensitivity, array support, etc.).
- Support non-user method invocations.
- Review context-sensitivity.
